description: This resource provides information about elasticity of forsterite to
  16 GPa and the composition of the upper mantle, aggregate bulk and shear moduli
  of forsterite as a function of pressure and sound velocities in (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 along
  1250 C adiabat compared to seismic velocity profiles for upper mantle.
